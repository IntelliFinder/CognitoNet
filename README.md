# Welcome to CognitoNet.

CognitoNet is a Mathematica implementation of Convolutional Neural Nets.

Objectives of the project are to make neural networks:

 - Accessible
 - Interactive
 - Flexible
 - Extensible
 - Efficient

in descending order of priority.

The package extends the machine learning capabilities of Mathematica (introduced in version 10) to multi layer convolutional nets. The package has been influenced by other popular machine learning systems, including Caffe and Torch, and Alex Krizhevsky's Convnet. However, it differs from these packages in that by using Mathematica it supports a highly interactive environment facilitating experimentation. It also has an unusually small code base (around 500 lines). Although other GPU based machine learning systems are faster, it is an objective that it should be sufficiently efficient to solve interesting and challenging problems such as CIFAR-10 and face detection.

The main application area so far is computer vision. In principle it could be of use in any other area where a feed forward neural network is applicable.

Use of this package assumes some familiarity with the concepts of a convolutional neural network, eg you have been following Geoffrey Hinton's Coursera course on neural networks (https://www.coursera.org/), or [Nando de Freitas Deep Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlhFWT7vAEw&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu&index=16) or you have equivalent knowledge.
